# Podcaster

A coding challenge for Zara :)

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the app in a development environment run:

```bash
npm start
```

(This will host a dev server to work with.)

### Production

To build the app to generate a production version of the app, run:

```bash
npm build
```

(This will generate a minified production build under 'build' directory)
